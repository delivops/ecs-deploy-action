# with file-based configuration and custom metrics port

# Basic environment variables
envs:
  - NODE_ENV: production
  - API_VERSION: v1

# Main application port
port: 8080

# OpenTelemetry collector using custom image
otel_collector:
  image_name: "amazon/config"     # Custom OTEL collector image
  extra_config: "config.yaml"    # Config file located at /conf/config.yaml in container
  metrics_port: 5000             # Custom metrics port (becomes CUSTOM_PORT env var)

# How this works:
# 1. Uses custom image: "amazon/config"
# 2. Configuration is loaded from file: /conf/config.yaml inside the container
# 3. Command used: --config /conf/config.yaml
# 4. Environment variables added to OTEL container:
#    - SERVICE_NAME: "app-with-custom-otel" (app name)
#    - CUSTOM_PORT: "5000" (metrics port)
# 5. No SSM configuration is used (file-based config instead)

# Prerequisites:
# - The custom image "amazon/config" should have the config file at /conf/config.yaml
# - The image should be accessible from your ECS environment
# - No AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store setup needed
